> **Type**: Ground-based Armoured Chassis
> **Tech Level**: FT
> 
> A highly customizable combat chassis that's designed to hold one main heavy [[Adaptive Modular Weapon Systems|AMWS]] Fragment and two secondary light AMWS Fragments. It features two support modular installation slots, and can fit at most ten people inside it. This is usually the most common combat chassis utilized by the [[The Hexagon|Hexagon]] and the [[The Immortal Regime|Regime]]. Without any AMWS emplacements, it's about 8ft in height, 32ft in length, and 15ft in width.

The Heavy Modular Combat Chassis is a blank-slate combat chassis that's utilized by the Hexagon and the Regime as a base for their vehicles.

Having a base height of about 8ft. and fitted with enough armour to withstand even minor orbital bombardments, it's mainly utilized to protect agents in the field in wide open areas. It lives up to its purpose well, so much so that it's able to be send into battle without any armaments, only relying on the agents tagging behind it for its offensive capabilities.

Featuring super-heavy kinetic shielding and extremely powerful defensive measures, it's more so used as a vehicle to spearhead assaults and to take hits from enemy units, than to be used in anti-armour and anti-emplacement missions (the [[RX0.7-2A Minute Anti-Armour Walker Unit|RX0.7-2A]] is instead used for this purpose). Loud and large, its purpose is to tank hits from enemy units, deflecting or mitigating them while still being able to counter-attack with high-powered weaponry. Less-protected units would usually tag behind or take cover behind such tanks.

Like all Hexagon vehicles, it features a spatial interference module that allows it to multiply its effective armour by warping and spacing out the armour it already has, while keeping its weight and size the same. However, it carries with it a more advanced module, increasing its effective armour twentyfold (or up to a hundredfold, if focused on a specific side), while allowing it to change its effective weight to better suit the gravity of the planet it's operating on.

Due to its armour, it's incapable of traversing uneven surfaces, which isn't really a problem, as the surfaces would usually be enough for agents to hide behind for cover anyway, fulfilling the vehicle's purpose. Its AMWS turret's rotation is also limited by the chassis' armour, which was designed to protect the crew and the units beside it.

It is capable of speeds up to 30km/h. Movement across long distances is possible with minimal maintenance, and fuel would be enough to allow the tank to traverse about one thousand miles if cut off from the Interlink. Using its advanced spatial interference modules, it's capable of lessening its weight just enough for dropships to carry it.

A high-powered [[Advanced Thaumaturgical Nullification Modules|nullification module]] is installed at the back of the chassis.
