> A military attachment that's utilized by most Hexagon departments as a last resort or as a rescue team of sorts.

**Related Notes:** 

The **Alpha-Liberty Emergency Response Team** is a highly specialized military attachment present in almost every department and division within the [[The Hexagon Empire|Hexagon]] war machine. Holding mainly experimental gear, and boasting superior training even when compared to the most elite frontline soldiers their department can provide, the Emergency Response Team is usually deployed during high-risk retrievals and other types of missions.

Usually, when a major outpost is destroyed, or if agent population dwindles to a minor fraction of what was originally deployed there due to attacks from hostile troops, the Emergency Response Team is usually called to [[com_protocol#Isolated Agent Avengement Protocol|deal with such events]] for extraction of wounded or imprisoned personnel, destruction of unused Hexagon gear, elimination of enemy troops, etc.

The Emergency Response Team usually consists of the most well-trained and well-equipped units and soldiers of their attached division. Their equipment, vehicles, and materiel are almost usually superior compared to their basic counterparts.

While the Emergency Response Team is a military attachment, it is not unusual for it to have several sub-departments of its own, depending on the location and what complex is handling it.
