**Related Notes:** 

**Void combat** is an extremely risky and dangerous area of combat that's performed by the [[The Hexagon|Hexagon]], the [[The Immortal Regime|Regime]], and any of their sufficiently advanced enemies. The battle-space where void combat would take place would be within Voidspace.

Due to the danger of Void Particles, ships and vessels do not last very long from within the Void, and as such, void combat is usually a battle of endurance, where ships initiate combat with other ships from within the Void, planning on opening a hole or creating a weakness on the enemy ship's shielding, allowing the Void to destroy it completely.

Should a battle take long enough, the longer lasting ship would usually win the battle, as the fleeing ship would have to make itself extremely vulnerable to fire as it slowly warps out of Voidspace. [[Surviving in the Void|Void shielding]] is limited, and a ship would have to return to [[Realspace|real-space]] in order to recuperate its shielding. Staying any longer than the shield is capable of would result in the ship being lost into the Void. Warping out of Voidspace is as equally dangerous as well, as the ship's [[Voidbound Weaponry|weapons]] would be inactive during the procedure to avoid any breaches in the already straining [[Void Piercer]]. Any opportunist ships could simply take shots at a fleeing ship, which would destroy the shielding should their weapons be strong enough.

Derelict cut-off sections of ships can be seen floating out and about in real-space, a testament to the dangers of the Void, where a major section would have been overtaken during the retreat, leaving but a fragment of the ship in real-space.

### Countermeasures
The Hexagon, and as a result the Regime, has developed several countermeasures that would prevent enemy ships from entering Voidspace in order to mask their approach towards Hexagon territory.

The most common type of detection system would be a [[Hexagon Advanced Voidreactive Countermeasure Sweep System|reactive countermeasure system]]: a large detector module (usually the size of a small planet) that sweeps a large area, looking for Void breaches. Once detected, several unmanned ships would immediately enter Voidspace, with the intent of attacking enemy ships that was detected.

As combat in the Void does not make use of ordinary munitions, [[Void-reactionary Ships]] would have thin hulls and small sizes, lessening weight and area, allowing on-board Void Piercers to operate with an extremely high efficiency. They would also have less powerful armaments, but it would be easily supplemented by their large numbers.
