> A term pertaining to a battlegroup-equivalent unit. Utilized by the Hexagon and the Regime.
> 
> Complexes only pertain to unique groups of agents or vehicles, however, not a mixture of both. Mixtures of both vehicle and unit complexes are known as [[Tesselation (unit)|Tessellations]]. The addition of carrier space-vessels to a complex is known as a [[Tangent (unit)|Tangent]].

**Related Notes:** 

**Complexes** are widely utilized in the Hexagon and in the Regime. Pertaining to unique agent battle-groups within a specific department, complexes are further divided to microcomplexes and nanocomplexes — battle-ready units that are dispatched in combat areas. It is extremely rare for a entire complex to be deployed as a whole, even in large and major combat areas.

As a complex is a battle-group of unique agents, the combination of two complexes are known as a <u>Truncation</u>. Truncations are still divided into microcomplexes and nanocomplexes.

| Unit         | No. of Agents         | Example of use in ORBAT                                                                                          |

| Complex      | 500,000 - 1,000,000   | [[Thanatos Operatives\|Thanatos]]' [[Hazardous Disposal Unit]] – 33rd [[Devastation Agent\|Devastation]] Complex |
| Truncation   | 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 | Thanatos' Hazardous Disposal Unit – 64th Truncation                                                              |
| Microcomplex | 20,000                | 33rd Suppressor Complex – 10th Microcomplex OR 64th Truncation's 10th Microcomplex                               |
| Nanocomplex  | 1,000                 | 10th Microcomplex – Nanocomplex A                                                                                |
