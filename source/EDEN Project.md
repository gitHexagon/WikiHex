**Related Notes:** 

The **EDEN Project** is a highly-classified research/military exercise devised by the [[The Hexagon Empire|Hexagon's]] [[Central High Command]] in order to test out weaponry against newly discovered species, as well as genetically engineered ones. This allows the Hexagon to properly determine the exact behaviours of a species without alerting them.

When a planet is deemed suitable for the EDEN Project, the largest military division present within the sector will begin to terraform and change the planet to fit the desired species' needs. From thereon out, the division will plant the seeds from which the species will begin to grow, usually clones or even lab-grown offspring. From there, the division will create an outpost with the bare minimal requirement of agents.

The planet is considered as a live arms testing platform, where the Hexagon would conduct controlled testing of weapons, gear, and arms against the natives. In other times, the natives will also be taken for experimentation, once the need arises.
