**Related Notes:** 

The **Ruination Agent** is a type of battle agent mainly deployed by the Regime's [[Solar Expeditionary Division]], whose objectives are nearly similar to the Hexagon's [[Kin Agent]]. Made to spearhead assaults and invasions of all risk levels, the Ruination Agent is equipped with enough protective equipment to withstand extremely lethal damages and survive through even the most inhospitable of landscapes. They are a direct upgrade from the basic [[Ordina|Ordinarius]] cannon-fodder.

The Ruination Agent is equipped with enhanced cybernetics, advanced magi-tech modules, improved and redundant vitals, as well as highly destructive gear and equipment.

They are capable of operating through even the most dangerous of combat situations, making them an improvement even over the most elite Neo-Hexagon agents.

They are one of the most, if not the most versatile agent to ever exist within the entire Hexagon Hierarchy.
