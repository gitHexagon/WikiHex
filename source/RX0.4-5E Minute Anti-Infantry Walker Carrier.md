**Related Notes:** 

The **RX0.4-5E Minute Anti-Infantry Walker Carrier** (MAW) is a light, unmanned armoured prism walker that's designed to act as a warp-anchor for invading or retreating [[The Hexagon Empire|Hexagon]] units. Designed similarly to regular [[Hexagon Prism Walkers|Prism Walkers]], it controls its legs by manipulating the [[Chenyll Force]], allowing it to balance itself however it sees fit. Also following the design principles of regular Prism Walkers, it boasts heavily armoured and barrier-enhanced frontal legs, allowing it to use them as a protective shield from where it can fire from.

The RX0.4-5E is equipped with a heavy automatic rail-cannon that's capable of tearing through 30mm of dense material, allowing it to deal damage to mid-tier armoured units or heavy aerial units.

While in Prism Mode, it boasts superior frontal armour and shield barriers, causing it to be near indestructible while it's in it Prism Mode, allowing it to traverse through heavy combat, forcing itself through enemy lines. With an extremely small profile of about 5ft x 3ft, added with its ability to distort the little amount of energy it passively releases, it's hard to pinpoint using specialized cameras, and extremely hard to target at longer ranges.
