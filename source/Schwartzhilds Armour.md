**Related Notes:** 

**Schwartzhild's Armour** is a type of projected armour that's worn by attaching its module at the back of an agent's neck. When activated, it enables several modules that provide the wielder with superior protection against physical and magical attacks, while delaying any form of damage caused by other methods of attacks until the agent is relieved of his armour.

The armour utilizes several redundant Escher's devices for protection, giving the agent an extremely powerful defensive advantage over the enemy. However, due to the devices' fields passing through each other from within a focal point that's directly above the module, it is imperative to the agent that they must not allow the Schwartzhild's Armour module to be attacked with a powerful piercing projectile or weapon.

The armour is mainly seen being wielded by heavy shock-troopers, specialized rapid support or advanced hard-hitting first response teams.
