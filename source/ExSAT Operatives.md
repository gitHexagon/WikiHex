**Related Notes:** 

The **ExSAT Operatives**, or the External Self-sustaining Assault and Tactics Operatives, is an extremely versatile military unit created in an attempt to disrupt enemy operations deep within non-Hexagon territorial borders, allowing the Hexagon to either have a backdoor within other territories, or to deploy their main military units in a combat situation where enemy units are left exposed with little to no reinforcement or resupply.

ExSAT Operatives are armed with both light and heavy weaponry, and are fitted with an [[ExSAT Gravestalker Armour|experimental armour]] that improves upon the dated [[Phoenix Operatives|Phoenix Operative]] [[Phoenix Armour|armour]]. Equipped with redundant vitals, excessive module attachments, advanced cybernetics, and magi-tech modules; and several instances of additional light protective armour, equipment, and shielding, coupled with multiple installations of [[Schwartzhilds Armour]] and even bearing rare [[Advanced Thaumaturgical Nullification Modules]]; ExSAT Operatives are designed to survive through extremely dangerous situations that may prove to be deadly or damaging to even the most well protected Hexagon units, making them one of the most well-protected agents in the entire Regime at the time of their formation. Built-in repair and medical modules are present within the armour to conduct automatic repairs on the armour and the agent, should something pierce through their shielding and armour.

ExSAT Operatives are supplied with a fabricator that will allow them to create most basic and some advanced equipment to assist them during their operations. It is their life blood, as it is their only way to break down materials to use for repairs or necessities.

The only agent to be supplied with multi-stage Void nanogenerators, ExSAT Operatives are capable of operating even theoretically past their supposed life span even without any connection to the [[Pierenne Interlink]].

Should an operative fall in combat, it may be revived by any surviving ExSAT within the field. However, should they be left behind for whatever reason, or if they are restrained without any possible method of escape, they may activate their last resort: a massive [[Void]] rift that would encompass a radius of about one-hundred meters or so (fallen operatives will automatically trigger this failsafe once all ExSAT Operatives escape or if they choose to manually trigger the failsafe, allowing it to explode even with any surviving operatives nearby).

Due to the operative being one of the most protected agent deployed by the Hexagon and even the Regime, if even one ExSAT Operative dies within the area of operations, the territory will immediately be designated to the highest danger level, even if said fallen is revived. It is then up to the High Command operating within that universe to determine what action should be taken.
