**Related Notes:** 

The [[The Hexagon Empire|Hexagon]]'s **SNS Complex** is a highly modular combat unit formulated by the Hexagon to operate within destroyed and contaminated landscapes with little to no cover nor resources. Usually deployed after a [[com_protocol|SXXN Protocol]], they're designed to quickly retake and conquer barren and desolate lands, usually accompanied by a few [[Hexagon Auxiliary Terraforming Unit Complex|ATU Complexes]] to further quicken territorial takeovers.

With each agent well protected by [[Escher's Field|Escher's Field Stabilizers]] and [[Schwartzhild's Armour]], the Hexagon can continue bombarding their coordinates for continuous effect without much damage to the agents. Supported by Prism Drones, the Complex and its units work very similarly to the Pentonic Army used in the 1950s.
