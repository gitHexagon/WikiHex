Holding mainly experimental gear, and boasting superior training even when compared to the most elite frontline soldiers their department can provide, the Emergency Response Team is usually deployed during high-risk retrievals and other types of missions. Usually, when a major outpost is destroyed, or if agent population dwindles to a minor fraction of what was originally deployed there due to attacks from hostile troops, the Emergency Response Team is usually called to deal with such events for extraction of wounded or imprisoned personnel, destruction of unused Hexagon gear, elimination of enemy troops, etc. The Emergency Response Team usually consists of the most well-trained and well-equipped units and soldiers of their attached division. Their equipment, vehicles, and materiel are almost usually superior compared to their basic counterparts.

Related Notes: The Containment and Disposal of Anomalous Materials Division is a major, unorthodox military force utilized by the Hexagon, only deployed in major combat areas populated by powerful and dangerous beings capable of causing massive destruction to a regular military unit. Tasked with the containment, extraction, and destruction of anomalous materials and beings, the CDAM is armed and supplied with state-of-the-art gear and equipment, and is made up of only the most highly trained agents within the Hexagon military. Comprised of four major divisions, the CDAM is fully equipped to combat most, if not all unorthodox enemies. These four major divisions include: The Chaos Division , a specialized command and control organization that utilizes the Thanatos Operatives , a heavy task force made to combat highly dangerous anomalous entities; The Hecate Division , an anti-thaumaturgical organization that handles two major units: the Gestalt Operatives , a large task-force made to tackle anything the Holymen could not handle, and the Catharzik Operatives , a smaller task-force designed to handle anything that could potentially destroy the mind, soul, body, and structure of any other agent; The Aether Division , the smallest, and yet, quite possibly the strongest organization within the CDAM\u2019s disposal.

Related Notes: The ExSAT Operatives , or the External Self-sustaining Assault and Tactics Operatives, is an extremely versatile military unit created in an attempt to disrupt enemy operations deep within non-Hexagon territorial borders, allowing the Hexagon to either have a backdoor within other territories, or to deploy their main military units in a combat situation where enemy units are left exposed with little to no reinforcement or resupply. ExSAT Operatives are armed with both light and heavy weaponry, and are fitted with an experimental armour that improves upon the dated Phoenix Operative armour .

Built-in repair and medical modules are present within the armour to conduct automatic repairs on the armour and the agent, should something pierce through their shielding and armour. ExSAT Operatives are supplied with a fabricator that will allow them to create most basic and some advanced equipment to assist them during their operations. It is their life blood, as it is their only way to break down materials to use for repairs or necessities. The only agent to be supplied with multi-stage Void nanogenerators, ExSAT Operatives are capable of operating even theoretically past their supposed life span even without any connection to the Pierenne Interlink . Should an operative fall in combat, it may be revived by any surviving ExSAT within the field. However, should they be left behind for whatever reason, or if they are restrained without any possible method of escape, they may activate their last resort: a massive Void rift that would encompass a radius of about one-hundred meters or so (fallen operatives will automatically trigger this failsafe once all ExSAT Operatives escape or if they choose to manually trigger the failsafe, allowing it to explode even with any surviving operatives nearby). Due to the operative being one of the most protected agent deployed by the Hexagon and even the Regime, if even one ExSAT Operative dies within the area of operations, the territory will immediately be designated to the highest danger level, even if said fallen is revived.

Related Notes: The Heavy Modular Combat Chassis is a blank-slate combat chassis that\u2019s utilized by the Hexagon and the Regime as a base for their vehicles. Having a base height of about 8ft. and fitted with enough armour to withstand even minor orbital bombardments, it\u2019s mainly utilized to protect agents in the field in wide open areas. It lives up to its purpose well, so much so that it\u2019s able to be send into battle without any armaments, only relying on the agents tagging behind it for its offensive capabilities. Featuring super-heavy kinetic shielding and extremely powerful defensive measures, it\u2019s more so used as a vehicle to spearhead assaults and to take hits from enemy units, than to be used in anti-armour and anti-emplacement missions (the RX0.7-2A is instead used for this purpose). Loud and large, its purpose is to tank hits from enemy units, deflecting or mitigating them while still being able to counter-attack with high-powered weaponry. Less-protected units would usually tag behind or take cover behind such tanks. Like all Hexagon vehicles, it features a spatial interference module that allows it to multiply its effective armour by warping and spacing out the armour it already has, while keeping its weight and size the same. However, it carries with it a more advanced module, increasing its effective armour twentyfold (or up to a hundredfold, if focused on a specific side), while allowing it to change its effective weight to better suit the gravity of the planet it\u2019s operating on. Due to its armour, it\u2019s incapable of traversing uneven surfaces, which isn\u2019t really a problem, as the surfaces would usually be enough for agents to hide behind for cover anyway, fulfilling the vehicle\u2019s purpose. Its AMWS turret\u2019s rotation is also limited by the chassis\u2019 armour, which was designed to protect the crew and the units beside it. It is capable of speeds up to 30km/h. Movement across long distances is possible with minimal maintenance, and fuel would be enough to allow the tank to traverse about one thousand miles if cut off from the Interlink.

Simply due to the danger of being in extremely close proximity to Void Particles , belligerents have thus developed several doctrines and tactics that are vastly different from ordinary space combat . Related Notes: Void combat is an extremely risky and dangerous area of combat that\u2019s performed by the Hexagon , the Regime , and any of their sufficiently advanced enemies. The battle-space where void combat would take place would be within Voidspace. Due to the danger of Void Particles, ships and vessels do not last very long from within the Void, and as such, void combat is usually a battle of endurance, where ships initiate combat with other ships from within the Void, planning on opening a hole or creating a weakness on the enemy ship\u2019s shielding, allowing the Void to destroy it completely. Should a battle take long enough, the longer lasting ship would usually win the battle, as the fleeing ship would have to make itself extremely vulnerable to fire as it slowly warps out of Voidspace. Void shielding is limited, and a ship would have to return to real-space in order to recuperate its shielding. Staying any longer than the shield is capable of would result in the ship being lost into the Void. Warping out of Voidspace is as equally dangerous as well, as the ship\u2019s weapons would be inactive during the procedure to avoid any breaches in the already straining Void Piercer . Any opportunist ships could simply take shots at a fleeing ship, which would destroy the shielding should their weapons be strong enough. Derelict cut-off sections of ships can be seen floating out and about in real-space, a testament to the dangers of the Void, where a major section would have been overtaken during the retreat, leaving but a fragment of the ship in real-space. Countermeasures \u00b6 The Hexagon, and as a result the Regime, has developed several countermeasures that would prevent enemy ships from entering Voidspace in order to mask their approach towards Hexagon territory. The most common type of detection system would be a reactive countermeasure system : a large detector module (usually the size of a small planet) that sweeps a large area, looking for Void breaches. Once detected, several unmanned ships would immediately enter Voidspace, with the intent of attacking enemy ships that was detected. As combat in the Void does not make use of ordinary munitions, Void-reactionary Ships would have thin hulls and small sizes, lessening weight and area, allowing on-board Void Piercers to operate with an extremely high efficiency.
