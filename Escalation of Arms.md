> A state of alert that's automatically calculated by onboard mainframe modules situated within the command and control vessels. Controls the quality and quantity of units to be deployed into battle.
> 
> The implementation of this alert state and its protocol has thus caused the [[The Immortal Regime|Regime]] to drastically change its usual order of battle, deciding not to send tangents directly into the fray, but instead only a few ships for data gathering. After that, the appropriate tangents and units would be deployed.

**Related Notes:** 

The Regime, learning from the wars that their predecessor organization has participated in, has begun to utilize a mobilization system that's dependent on the state of combat within the region. Aptly named the **Escalation Protocol**, this state of alert is automatically calculated by onboard mainframe modules from within command and control vessels.

**These modules take in real-time data from units currently participating in combat, and mobilizes the necessary agents and vessels accordingly.**
*Should 60% of the currently deployed forces be destroyed, the Escalation Protocol would be activated and the state of escalation is immediately advanced by one level, up to $Dynamic\, State\, C_{10}$.*
*Should the data gathering vessels be destroyed before the main forces arrive, the state of escalation is raised immediately to $Dynamic\, State\, Z_6^1$.*
