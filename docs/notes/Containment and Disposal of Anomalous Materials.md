**Related Notes:** 

The **Containment and Disposal of Anomalous Materials** Division is a major, unorthodox military force utilized by the Hexagon, only deployed in major combat areas populated by powerful and dangerous beings capable of causing massive destruction to a regular military unit. Tasked with the containment, extraction, and destruction of anomalous materials and beings, the CDAM is armed and supplied with state-of-the-art gear and equipment, and is made up of only the most highly trained agents within the Hexagon military.

Comprised of four major divisions, the CDAM is fully equipped to combat most, if not all unorthodox enemies.

These four major divisions include:
- The [[Chaos Division]], a specialized command and control organization that utilizes the [[Thanatos Operatives]], a heavy task force made to combat highly dangerous anomalous entities;
 
- The [[Hecate Division]], an anti-thaumaturgical organization that handles two major units: the [[Gestalt Operatives]], a large task-force made to tackle anything the [[Holymen of the Overseer's Vision|Holymen]] could not handle, and the [[Catharzik Operatives]], a smaller task-force designed to handle anything that could potentially destroy the mind, soul, body, and structure of any other agent;

- The [[Aether Division]], the smallest, and yet, quite possibly the strongest organization within the CDAM's disposal. The Aether Division is tasked with one job only: to destroy any divine entity, demon or god, who stands in the Hexagon's way;

- And lastly, the [[Morpheus Division]]. The division operates secretly under the watchful eyes of the [[Hexagon Overseer|Overseer]]'s [[Central High Command]]. The Morpheus Division handles most of the Hexagon's [[Dreamer Agent|Dreamers]], tasked by safeguarding the souls and dreamscapes of Hexagon territories, preventing any malicious intent by any dimensional being capable of invading through dimensions and/or the [[Main Transdimensional Lucid-based Dreamscape|dreamscape]].
