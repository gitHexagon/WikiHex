**Related Notes:** 

The **Suppressor Agent** is a specialized advanced battle agent deployed by the Immortal Regime. There are two types of Suppressor Agents, both utilized by [[Containment and Disposal of Anomalous Materials|CDAM]], mainly [[Chaos Division]] and [[Hecate Division]]. Being CDAM's main battle agent, Suppressors are rather ubiquitous within the department, mainly used to siege heavily fortified strongpoints, or to combat unorthodox enemies such as deities, magical creatures, and the supernatural.

Whilst being mainly utilized by CDAM, Suppressor Agents may also be present under the Solar Expeditionary Division.

Equipped with Schwartzhild armour, advanced cybernetics, specialized magi-tech modules, advanced redundant vitals, and specialized additional armour and protective equipment such as actual kinetic shielding and barriers. All this, while combined with experimental chronospatial gear, make for an extremely deadly agent.

Capable of operating in all but the most inhospitable and dangerous environments, Suppressors are usually the next agents deployed should the regular Ruination agents prove insufficient to handle the threat.
