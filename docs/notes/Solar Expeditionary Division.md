> The main military force of the Neo-Hexagon Empire and the Immortal Regime.

**Related Notes:** 

The **Solar Expeditionary Division** is the largest single military force that the Neo-Hexagon and the Immortal Regime has. The head of a multitude of sub-departments, they oversee and manage most of the brunt of the Hexagon war machine, capable of supplying conflicts in faraway sectors and more.

The division's secondary role is to occupy and terraform uncolonized sectors and planets to further expand the Hexagon's territory.

Unique to the Solar Expeditionary Division is its clearance specifications. Unlike other departments, whose gear is tightly restricted according to their clearances, the division is granted the ability to supply their agents with gear that's higher than their original clearances (usually T3.R310), up to T7.R220 grade specifications.

However, should this prove insufficient, the Solar Expeditionary Division will be pulled back and their duties will be replaced by the [[Containment and Disposal of Anomalous Materials|CDAM]].
