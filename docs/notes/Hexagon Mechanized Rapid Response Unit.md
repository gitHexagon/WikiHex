**Related Notes:** 

The [[The Hexagon Empire|Hexagon]]'s **Mechanized Rapid Response Unit** is a heavily outfitted unit whose goal is to be the first line of defense or the first vanguard of an attack. As such, they're designed to be quick and mobile, and are expected to adapt to any environment or outcome. Outfitted by very generalized heavy gear, with their most advanced shock troopers even wielding [[Schwartzhild's Armour]], they're expected to gather initial intelligence for the main force to determine the best course and method of attack.

During an assault, slipspace aircraft will bombard the area with [[neuro-suppressant chemical agents]], allowing the unit to operate with minimized resistance from unprotected enemy units. From thereon out, the following [[slipspace aircraft]] will begin to drop [[warp capsules]] that will serve as the rapid response unit's gateway to the battlefield, where a multitude of heavy-duty agent complexes, [[prism walkers]], and [[auxiliary robotic military]] units will populate the battlefield in less than a minute, preventing the enemy from establishing a proper counter force in time.

If the planet has [[FTL inhibitors]], then the Rapid Response Unit will utilize a lone assault ship to attempt a quick land invasion to shut down said inhibitors. If calculated to be ineffective, the unit will attempt a [[brute-force spatial tear]] to infiltrate the planet. If proven unsuccessful, then the unit will utilize a [[Void-class dreadnought]].
