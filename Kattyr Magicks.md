> Done through runes, the magicks of the Kattyr are capable of enchanting objects and outputting power. They draw their power through what they call as the ‘soul’, a source of seemingly unlimited energy.

**Related Notes:** 

Kattyr Magick is done by etching runes into objects. These runes are found with three symbols: the cause, the intent, and the power. The rune responsible for ‘cause’ would determine the rune’s energy type. The rune responsible for the ‘intent’ would determine if the output of the rune would be dispensed outward or inward; either dispensing or imbuing the energy. The ‘power’ would determine the strength of the output, as well as the ability of the rune.

Despite general belief, the source of the magicks does not have an infinite amount of energy. The overuse of such runes has slowly caused the power of said source to dwindle, which led to future runes being less powerful compared to the very first runes. This has been first noticed during the Great Decline. As such, scholars have begun to place pieces of the “soul” within orbs, where a Kattyr may tap into that source of energy instead, allowing them to create much more powerful runes. This has caused several wars to take place in an attempt to grab as much orbs as they can.

Fast forward to several millennia, the “soul” is almost extinguished, with scholars realising that it’s regaining its energy, albeit very slowly. It would take at least another couple of millennia for it to regain enough power to allow for the creation of runes as powerful as the ones made during the Great Decline, forcing the Kattyr to restrict the knowledge of the usage of the “soul” to the general populace, preventing them from further deteriorating the “soul” before it can be restored to its former glory. Such knowledge is only passed down to the  lineage of the most important Kattyr of the time.

In recent times, due to the ignorance of several other kingdoms, the knowledge of the “soul” and its power is nearly lost, with the remaining descendants of the past scholars being almost wiped out due to a power struggle.

Due to the usefulness of the orbs, it has been used as the currency in most, if not all of the kingdoms and cities. The worth of such orbs is equivalent to how much energy is stored within them, and only the most wealthy of the people are able to create runes that would be able to best anyone else.
